            <p>Hi! I am Mekenzie, I am a software engineer but by now you probably know that! </p> <p>I am also an adventurer, chef, dog mom, aunt, graphic designer, reader, and home renovator. I am happiest laughing with friends and family, being by the mountains or the water, eating tacos, or trying out a new workout. I have lived all over the United States with a passion for finding the hole in the wall bookstore, antique shop, and dive bar to pass time and meet new people. If you see me scrolling on my phone I am most likely debating dying my hair or figuring out what I will be making for dinner.</p><p> I hope you have enjoyed learning a little about me and find my work intriguing. Shoot me a message for questions, comments, or to just send over a delicious new recipe! </p>

            <p>Hi! I am Mekenzie, I am a software engineer! </p> 
            <p>Early in my career, I was building HTML email wireframes for marketing campaigns while more recently I created a Squarespace eCommerce website for a small business that quickly outgrew the platform. It was these jobs that eventually launched my career change. Going through General Assembly didnâ€™t only teach me how to code and think logically but how to learn quickly, seek out advice from the coding community,  and work directly with a team of engineers. I may be newer to the engineering community but I make up for it with my ambition, innovation, and creativity.</p>
            <p>I thrive in creative, collaborative, and fast-paced environments with room to grow and learn while wearing many different hats.  As a marketing manager, I spearheaded a project collaborating with multiple teams and executive members. Under a tight deadline, I was able to provide a month-to-month guide of marketing campaigns and store strategy for two brands and over 200 franchisees to assure franchisee success and brand consistency. While I left shortly after they were distributed I got feedback on the thoroughness and a clearer understanding of how marketing with each store should work. </p>
            <p>It is clear to most that I am motivated and detail-oriented but it is ultimately my outgoing friendly personality and positive character that people know me by. I believe that it is this experience paired with the technical skills that make me a great fit for many different positions.</p>
            <p>I am also an adventurer, chef, dog mom, aunt, graphic designer, reader, and home renovator. I am happiest laughing with friends and family, being by the mountains or the water, eating tacos, or trying out a new workout. I have lived all over the United States with a passion for finding the hole in the wall bookstore, antique shop, and dive bar to pass time and meet new people. If you see me scrolling on my phone I am most likely planning my next adventure or figuring out what to make for dinner.</p>
            <p> I hope you have enjoyed learning a little about me and find my work intriguing. Shoot me a message for questions, comments, or to just send over a delicious new recipe! </p>
